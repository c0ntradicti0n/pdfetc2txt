The key difference between ectomorph mesomorph and endomorph lies in their body size and structure. Ectomorph is a body type that has a thin body, small shoulders, flat chest, and a delicate bone structure while mesomorph is a body type which has wide shoulders, a narrow waist, relatively thin joints, and round muscle bellies. Endomorph, on the other hand, is the third body type which has a thick ribcage, wide hips, and shorter limbs.
Ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph are the three basic body types. Our lifestyle, genetics, history and training style are the major factors that decide the body type. Moreover, we can change our body type over time with proper dieting and exercises. Ectomorph body type is thin and has long limbs and small muscle bellies. Mesomorph body is the middle type, which is easy to gain weight or easy to lose weight. They have a rectangular shaped body with round muscle bellies. Endomorph is wider than an ectomorph or mesomorph, with a thick ribcage, wide hips, and shorter limbs. Endomorph can easily gain weight but find it very hard to lose weight.

7. Summary
What is Ectomorph?
Ectomorph is one of the three body types. Ectomorphs have thin bodies or they are skinny. They have long limbs and small muscle bellies. Moreover, they have small joints and lean muscles. Their shoulders are thin and less wide. Furthermore, they have a flat chest. Their metabolism is fast, and they burn calories very fast. Hence, they find it very difficult to gain weight. They struggle to gain weight and their biggest goal is to gaining muscle weight. Due to this fact, ectomorphs are also known as hard gainers.
What is Mesomorph?
Mesomorph is the second or middle body type between ectomorph and endomorph. Mesomorphs tend to have wide shoulders, a narrow waist, relatively thin joints, and round muscle bellies. They are naturally strong and relatively muscular. Their body is somewhat rectangular in shape.
Figure 01: Body Types
Mesomorphs serve as the best body type for bodybuilding because mesomorphs can be easily gained weight or lose weight. Therefore, mesomorphs should be careful about calorie intake.

What is Endomorph?
Endomorph is the third body type and appears a bit stockier. They can gain weight easily. Endomorph body type is solid and generally soft. They are usually of a shorter build with thick arms and shorter limbs.
Similar to mesomorphs, they are naturally stronger and fit. Generally, they are short and wider. They have a thick ribcage and wide hips. Furthermore, their metabolism is slow.
What are the Similarities Between Ectomorph Mesomorph and Endomorph?

Ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph are three body types.
It is necessary to understand these three types prior to bodybuilding training.
Moreover, understanding of all three body types is helpful in balancing calories uptake and help to stay healthy.

What is the Difference Between Ectomorph Mesomorph and Endomorph?
Ectomorph is the body type which has a thin body, small shoulders, flat chest, and delicate bone structure while mesomorph is the body type which has wide shoulders, a narrow waist, relatively thin joints, and round muscle bellies and endomorph is the third body type which has a rounder appearance, thick ribcage, wide hips, and shorter limbs. So this is the key difference between ectomorph mesomorph and endomorph. Ectomorphs have long limbs while mesomorphs have relatively long limbs while endomorphs have short limbs. Thus, this is also a difference between ectomorph mesomorph and endomorph. Moreover, ectomorphs have a fast metabolism while mesomorphs and endomorphs have slow metabolisms.
The below info-graphic tabulates further differences between ectomorph mesomorph and endomorph.

Summary – Ectomorph Mesomorph vs Endomorph
Ectomorph, mesomorph and endomorph are three body types. Ectomorphs are skinny while mesomorphs are naturally athletic looking. Endomorphs are shorter and rounder. Ectomorphs find it difficult to put on muscle mass while mesomorphs are able to gain muscle fairly easily and endomorphs tend to gain weight and muscle easily. Ectomorphs have thin shoulders with little width. Mesomorphs have somewhat wide muscular shoulders while endomorph has wider shoulders. So, this summarizes the difference between ectomorph mesomorph and endomorph.
